     * How to use this trial type:
     *
     * This trial was designed to demonstrate how to filter by demographics.
     * In this example, we are filtering out participants who are younger than 18.
     * To make this work, we would first need to ask a survey, using the survey trial type,
     * on the previous row in the Procedure file. This survey will need to ask them how old
     * they are, and the "Question Name" for this question should simply be "Age". Then, in
     * this trial, we are going to check the data associated with "Age", and see if it meets
     * our criterion of being 18 or greater.
     *
     * To modify this, you can simply change the data you are looking for, using the general
     * structure of $responses[ QUESTION_NAME ]. So, if you wanted to filter by gender instead,
     * you could create a survey which has one of the questions with the Question Name of "Gender",
     * and then in this trial, check if $responses["Gender"] is equal to "Male" or "Female".
     * * */
